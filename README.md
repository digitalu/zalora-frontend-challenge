# zalora-frontend-challenge
### Task
The code here demonstrates a checkmark animation when the Add-to-Cart button is clicked.

- Layout shows the Desktop layout of Zalora. It is _not_ responsive.
- Size must be selected first
- Upon click, I faked a API call to display a spinner
- Upon success, checkmark is displayed.

Zalora Global SCSS is installed as a submodule.

```
$ npm install
$ gulp serve
```

Run `gulp` & view at http://localhost:3000
